Shaun, the author of this blog is a semi-geek, clumsy developer, passionate speaker and incapable architect with about 10 yearsâ€™ experience in .NET and JavaScript. He hopes to prove that software development is art rather than manufacturing. He's into cloud computing platform and technologies (Windows Azure, Amazon and Aliyun) and right now, Shaun is being attracted by JavaScript (Angular.js and Node.js) and he likes it.

Shaun is working at [Worktile Inc](https://www.worktile.com). as the chief architect for overall design and develop worktile, a web-based collaboration and task management tool, and lesschat, a real-time communication aggregation tool.
